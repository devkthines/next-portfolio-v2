    <p>My name is Chase Ohlson. I’m a frontend software engineer & freelance web developer in Los Angeles -- with roots in digital marketing & SEO. I'm passionate about music, technology and basically everything that makes the internet tick.

My work currently consists of a
 full time engineering role at The Noun Project (working on Lingo) & managing ongoing freelance clients and side projects. I find this balancing act to be super resourceful in terms my learning as a web developer, as well as for keeping up with the rapid expansion of developer tools, libraries, frameworks, etc.
